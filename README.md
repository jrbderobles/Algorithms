* **Tower of Hanoi** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)

  It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top.
  The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following simple rules:

  * Only one disk may be moved at a time.
  * Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or an empty rod.
  * No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

* **Inverting Binary Tree** (https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-invert-a-binary-tree)

  An inversion, or mirror, of a Binary Tree (T), is just a Binary Tree M(T) whose left and right children (of all non-leaf nodes) are swapped.

* **Reversing a Linked List** (Self-explanatory)
